More great enhancements by @DM9290:
Combat Tracker - Adding creatures with a speed >1 to the combat tracker now automatically creates additional tokens (aka clones) in the combat tracker to represent multiple initiatives in a turn. 
The clones can still be individually removed in the combat tracker if the GM needs to (for some reason), and all of them will go away if the actual token on the map is marked as no longer 'in combat' with the combat toggle HUD tool.
The Armor mod dialogue box no longer prompts for stress.
Creature attack roll visibility is now controlled by the GM Chat roll privacy settings dropdown. 
Synthetics now control whether or not they can make fake panic rolls, or get a push button with an checkbox option on the character sheet to 'Imitate human stress and panic rolls'. 
    Open synthetics like Bishop or David or Working Joes turn it off and they wont panic even if the Stress roll is executed. 
    Their skill rolls will not have a push button.
    Secret synths can have it turned on, and they can make fake panic rolls (never rolling above 6) and their skill and ability rolls will have a push button just like human characters. clicking push wont actually cause them to push. It just looks real.

Added System sheet for BBW
Added Colony sheet for BBW along with a new item for adding Colony Initiatives.  Drag and drop onto the sheet.  Modifiers are automatically added to the development total. 
The Colony sheet has pop-up boxes to show the modifier totals for the key stats and Development total. 

On rolling a Facehugger the system will automatically make a panic roll for the player.  
This can be turned off by the GM, in the Alien PRG configuration by unchecking "Automatically Roll Panic"

Depending on the result Panic rolls will now: 
1. Increment/Decrement the panicking actors stress.
2. Create an item to impose the modification (-2 Agility or -2 All Skills for Space Combat Panic Roll). 
3. Add text to the chat for rolls >=10 saying that the action has failed.
When panic is removed the -2 Agility/-2 All Skills modification items are automatically deleted.

Critical Injuries are now created with any PC's Skill modifiers applied to the item. 

Added a Swap Initiative option to the Combat tracker to allow the GM to swap player initiative.

Bug Fixes:
Fixed issue with Critical Injury #31 that was applying -2 modifiers rather than -1 modifiers.
