Version 1.0.3
Removed the Add Item button from the Inventory page as it's confusing. Items, weapons etc. should be created from the Item tab then dragged to the character sheet.  
Corrected an error with the dice rolling mechanic.  
Push rolls now show total successes from both rolls.

Known issues: 
Weapon rolls on the vehicle template do not work correctly because there is no Ranged Combat attribute which should be derived from the operator (actor).  
I am considering the best way to fix this.   

Version 1.0.4
Added a "Rounds" text box to the Weapons template to allow the player to keep track of ammo.
Added the table roll number to the chat output for stress rolls.

You just need to open each skill and edit the text with the Stunts from the rule book.
Updated "Mother Instructions".       

Version 1.1.6
System should now work with Foundry V0.7.3
Added an NPC check box to the Character and Synth sheets only visible to the GM.

Version 1.1.7 - Bug fix
In my eagerness to get the dice system working with FVTT V0.7.3 I broke the dice rolling for V0.6.6 !

Version 1.2.8
Backed out package loaded fonts as "The Forge" tries to get hem from the Bazaar rather than the defined source location.

Add a context sensitive menu to items lists.  Right click on the edit icon to get edit or delete options.

Creature templates now have Health X/X for current/max which allows the token bar to operate properly.

The idea is that the GM can create "secret" agendas for the players put them in a Compendium and make it visible only to the GM.

Lastly a big thank you to @DM9290 for the following excellent enhancements/fixes:
Inventory - Adding ammo to an RPG (must have RPG in the name) will increase the weight by 0.5kg
Character Sheet - PANICKED condition when active now shows the current panic level of the PC.
ENHANCEMENT- Make SquareGrid calculate distances using euclidean distance to the nearest cm.
BUGFIX - Fix a bug where PUSHing a skill roll gives stress to the selected token rather than the original actor. 
ENHANCEMENT- Now synthetics can  make panic checks by clicking on "No Stress"- synthetics never actually panic, but the result shows up as if they Keep it Together. 
ENHANCEMENT- When actors become panicked their Token now shows the 'fear' overlay. When they stop being panicked their fear overlay vanishes.  
BUGFIX - fixed a bug where skill checks were not properly respecting the visibility of rolls. 
He also cleaned up some of my code which I really appreciate.

Updated MO/TH/ER Instructions  -  Please Read :) .
Maestro Add-on sound effects should not work on items. 

More great enhancements by @DM9290:
Combat Tracker - Adding creatures with a speed >1 to the combat tracker now automatically creates additional tokens (aka clones) in the combat tracker to represent multiple initiatives in a turn. 
The clones can still be individually removed in the combat tracker if the GM needs to (for some reason), and all of them will go away if the actual token on the map is marked as no longer 'in combat' with the combat toggle HUD tool.
The Armor mod dialogue box no longer prompts for stress.
Creature attack roll visibility is now controlled by the GM Chat roll privacy settings dropdown. 
Synthetics now control whether or not they can make fake panic rolls, or get a push button with an checkbox option on the character sheet to 'Imitate human stress and panic rolls'. 
    Open synthetics like Bishop or David or Working Joes turn it off and they wont panic even if the Stress roll is executed. 
    Their skill rolls will not have a push button.
    Secret synths can have it turned on, and they can make fake panic rolls (never rolling above 6) and their skill and ability rolls will have a push button just like human characters. clicking push wont actually cause them to push. It just looks real.
Corrected issue where pressing enter on an attribute field cause Health to decrease.

Power Consumables:   The Power supply roll button has been removed from the General tab.   
    Power rolls are now carried out per item on the Inventory tab by clicking on the number under the "Pwr" heading.  
    As per the rules all available Power dice will be rolled but failures will only be removed from the power rating of that item.
