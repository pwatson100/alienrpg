Unfortunately he no longer supports the module so I have incorporated it into the core system.<br>The UI components are now on by default and the sheets can be changed, by the players, selecting the CRT UI button on the 'Configure Alien RPG Settings' menu.<br><strong>Remember...</strong> Back up your worlds before upgrading to the new version. <br>Please read the @JournalEntry[MU/TH/ER Instructions.] to get the most benefit out of using the system and new features."

PLEASE, make a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmbxMmqNNXU'>backup</a>, especially if you are going from Foundry v9 to Foundry v10. There are a couple of new features in v10 and some bugs squashed, but the majority of work has been to make it stable and ready for Foundry v10.</p><p>Note that while Alien v9 and the modules works perfectly fine, there are no plans to enhance them further nor provide further bug-fixes for them going forward. </p>I am active in the <a href='https://discord.gg/foundryvtt'>#free-league</a> channel on the Foundry discord.</a>.</p>"
