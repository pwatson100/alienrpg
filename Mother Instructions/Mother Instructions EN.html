      Official system for playing the ENNIE award winning Alien RPG by Free League on Foundry VTT.
      <br /><br />
      Free League have now officially endorsed the system and we have been working to provide official content to enhance the system (see Official Modules
      below).
      <br /><br />
      Developed for Foundry FTT by Paul Watson
      <br /><br />
      If you like my system please consider buying me a coffee: <a href="https://ko-fi.com/paulwatson">https://ko-fi.com/paulwatson</a> <br />

    <h1 class="heading">Welcome to Alien Evolved</h1>
    <p>
      In this version of Alien I have rewritten a lot of the back end code to take advantage of Foundry's Data new models and App V2 UI improvements. <br />
      With the large number of changes I have made I am sure there will be things I left out or bugs i have missed in testing. <br />
      My aim in this version is to allow GM's to switch between the Classic Alien rules and the new Evolved rules. <br /><br />
      As with all things time is an issue so these instructions do not currently cover all the changes I have made to support the Evolved system. I will be
      updating in the future.
    </p>
    <h1 class="heading">NOTE:</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>
        By default the system will run in Alien "Classic" mode. To switch to "evolved" mode go to Configure Settings>Alien Evolved> Use Alien Evolved Rules and
        Sheets and hit the checkbox.
      </strong>

      Should you wish to populate the system with game content for your own use please purchase the rules from Free League Publishing:
      https://frialigan.se/en/games/alien/ or better still purchase the Starter Set or Core Rules modules.
      <br /><br />
      My intention is to enable people to play Alien RPG remotely and not to create a fully enabled/automated system. MU/TH/UR will still need to do some work.

    <p>
      Right Click is used quite a bit in the system. If in doubt, try it out. <br />
      Examples are: <br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right click an edit button to choose delete / edit</li>
      <li>Right click to clear radio buttons</li>
      <li>Right click a “roll” to enter modifiers before a roll</li>
    </ul>

  <div style="position: relative; margin-top: 30px">
    <h1 class="heading">Actors</h1>
    <p>There are six main types of Actors available in the system:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Characters</li>
      <li>Synthetics</li>
      <li>Creatures</li>
      <li>Spaceships</li>
      <li>Vehicles</li>
      <li>Territories</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this section I will go over the common areas of the Character and Synthetic sheets.<br /><br /></p>

    <p>
      Health is not automatically calculated so needs to be updated manually as per the rules.
      <br />
      <br />
      For the GM, an NPC tick box is visible which changes the Token settings for the actor (see Tokens section).
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading2">Details (2)</h3>

    <p>
      In the Career dropdown you can select the appropriate career for the PC. <br />
      Any specialities that have been dragged on to the character sheet will show under the Career dropdown. <br />
      These can be displayed and edited in the same way as Talents on the Skills tab. <br />
      The details boxes are text fields to record short details about the PC's.
    </p>
    &nbsp;<span class="character-details">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;

    <h3 class="heading2">Tracking (3)</h3>

    <p>The left sidebar enables the player to track Experience, Radiation, Conditions, Consumables and Armor.<br /><br /></p>

    &nbsp;<span class="character-consumables">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    <p>
      <br />
      Experience, Story Points, Radiation and Conditions are radio buttons. Left mouse click on the dot to set and Right mouse click on the dot to unset.
      <br /><br />

      Adding Radiation will cause a roll to determine if there is any health damage caused by the radiation. <br />
      <strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> If there is it must be applied manually I did not automate this in case there are any cures to be applied.
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="radiation-roll">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
      <br />
      Right click to remove radiation after a visit to the medbay or cure. This will make a permanent radiation check by rolling a 1d6, on a &nbsp;<span
        class="stresssymbol"
        >&nbsp;</span
      >&nbsp; permanent radiation will be added to the right side of the radiation bar. <br />
      Actors with permanent radiation will always have the "Radiation" condition icon showing on their token even if they have no temporary radiation.
    </p>
    <div class="imagecontainer">
      <img src="systems/alienrpg/images/mother-instructions/perm-radiation.webp" style="width: 40%; margin-bottom: 0%" alt="" />
    </div>
    <p>
      Permanent radiation can <strong>ONLY BE REMOVED OR ADDED BY THE GM.</strong> <br />
      CTRL-Right click on the character sheet to remove. <br />
      Adding permanent radiation is done by a CTRL-Left click.
      <br /><br />

      Overwatch is a (left click) toggle and gives an "Eye" status icon on the token so show the actor is in Overwatch.
      <br /><br />
      If the player has an <strong>active</strong> token in the scene a status icon will show for any conditions set:
      <br />
    </p>
    &nbsp;<span class="status-icons-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br />
    <p>
      Right clicking on the condition will remove the status icon.
      <br />
      <b> NOTE:</b> <i>Removing the status icon from the token HUD will not remove the condition on the actor sheet. </i> <br /><br />
      The "Panicked" condition will automatically set following panic rolls of 7+. This triggers the "More Panic" mechanics in the system. To remove the
      Panicked condition right click on the “PANICKED” dot. This will reset the PC's panic level to 0. When active it will also display the “Panic Level” to the
      player to show how near breaking they are.
      <br /><br />
      <b> NOTE:</b> <i>This does not affect their Stress level.</i> <br /><br />
      The consumables and Armor values are updated automatically based on the "Active" items in the PC's Inventory (See Inventory for more details.)
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading2">Consumables</h3>
    <p>
      In the system all the items "Active" consumable values are combined to give these totals. All supply rolls will rolla maximum of 6 supply dice as per the
      rules. <br />
      <br />
      For Air, Food and Water just click on the Parachute icon to make a supply roll. Failures are removed from the value of the corresponding items in the PCs
      Inventory in the order they were added.
      <br /><br />
      Power supply rolls are made against the individual items on the Inventory tab by clicking on the value in the Pwr column. <br />
      This will roll the total number of power dice (to a maximum of 6) but on a failure (Facehugger) will only deduct from the item the power roll is made for.
      <br /><br />
      This is a near as I can get to the actual rules which are a little vague when it comes to Power supply rolls. &nbsp;<span class="pwr-supply">&nbsp;</span
      >&nbsp;
      <br />
      Once the power level is zero it will no longer roll and the player will need to edit the item in order to change the power level.
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading2">Armor</h3>
    <p>
      Clicking on Armor will roll the combined value of any active armor (total shown in the box). <br />
      Right clicking will display a modifier box with one-click options for "Armor Piercing" (half armor value) and "Armor Doubled" (2 x armor value).
      <br /><br />
      Additionally, right or left clicking on the name of armor on the Inventory tab will also perform an Armor roll or show a modification chat box.
      <br />
    </p>
    &nbsp;<span class="armor-mod">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;

    <p><br /><br /></p>
    <h2 class="heading2">Critical Injuries (4)</h2>
    <p>
      Players can roll their own Critical Hits by clicking on the "Roll Crit" button. This looks for a table named "Critical injuries" for Characters. If the
      table does not exist an error message is displayed.
      <br /><br />
      Right Clicking on the edit icon to the right will display a context menu allowing injury to be edited or deleted.
      <br /><br />
      If you have the Core Rules or Starter Set modules enabled when on rolling a Critical Injury for a PC or Synthetic the Critical Injury item will be
      automatically created and added to the actors sheet. <br />
      You will have to manually add any modifiers the injury has on the character to the tab modifiers tab on the injury item. <br />
      <br />
      Right clicking on the "Roll Crit" button will display a dialogue box allowing the player/GM to enter a specific critical injury number. This must be in
      D66 format (number 11 to 16, 21 to 26 etc.) for Characters and D6 format for Synthetics (1-6). This then rolls against the relevent table, writes to chat
      and creates the item on the sheet as per normal. <br />
      <br /><br />
      Using the Item type "critical-injury" a GM can create their own Critical Injury items which can then be dragged on to the sheet and will be displayed in
      this section and have the same controls for viewing, editing and deleting as a normal item.
      <br /><br />
      It is now possible to create your own Cirt tables for Characters and Synthetics.
      <br /><br />
      The roll tables must be called "Critical Injuries" and "Critical Injuries on Synthetics".
      <br /><br />
      The Critical Injuries table for Characters must use the following Roll Table Formula : 10*1d6+1d6 and be constructed as a d66 table with ranges from 11 to
      16, 21 to 26 and so on. Each of the entries but be constructed in the following format. If you do not use this format the injury items will not be created
      correctly and the system will error.
      <br /><br />

      A template can be found in the systems/alienrpg/macros folder called "fvtt-RollTable-critical-injuries-template.json".<br />
      It is recommended that you copy and edit this file then import into your game.

    </ul>

    <p>
      <br />
      For "Critical Injuries on Synthetics" the table must have a Roll Table Formula of 1d6.
      <br /><br />
      Each of the entries but be constructed in the following format. If you do not use this format the injury items will not be created correctly and the
      system will error.

    <h2 class="heading">Skills Tab (5)</h2>
    <p>
      The Skills tab lists the skills available to players. These are updated by the player during character creation. <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="moskills">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br />
      Left mouse click will roll the value, taking into account current stress dice. <br />
      A Right mouse click will display a modifier dialogue box allowing you to add or subtract Base and Stress dice to the roll. <br />
      For instance, having the Field Surgeon Talent gives a +2 modification to Medical Aid, so you would add 2 to the base dice in the modifier box.
      <br /><br />
      Skill rolls are combined with the associated attribute values and Stress dice when making rolls.
      <br /><br />
      Clicking on the spanner icon&nbsp;<span class="spanner-icon">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;next to a skill will display the appropriate stunts for that skill at the
      bottom of the sheet, a second click hides the description. (See Skill Stunts below). <br /><br />
      &nbsp;<span class="talent-agenda">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
      <br />
      The Talents and Agenda/Story Cards sections allow the player/GM to drop talent and agenda items (see below) onto the characters sheet. Clicking on the
      item’s name will display the items description at the bottom of the sheet. A second click hides the description.
      <br /><br />
      Right Clicking on the edit icon to the right will display a context menu allowing the PCs version of the item to be edited or deleted. &nbsp;<span
        class="con-edit"
        >&nbsp;</span
      >&nbsp; <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Inventory Tab (6)</h2>
    <p>
      At the top of the tab is the Encumbrance meter. This shows the "Total Carried / Maximum Encumbrance" where Maximum Encumbrance is Str *4. The two arrows
      on the Encumbrance show the point at which the PC should be taking penalties for being over encumbered.
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="enc">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
      <br />
      When the carried items exceed this point the bar will turn red and flash.
    </p>
    &nbsp;<span class="enc-warn">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br />
    <p><br /><br /></p>

    <p>If the player has an <strong>active</strong> token in the scene a status icon will show: <br /><br /></p>

    &nbsp;<span class="enc-icon-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;

    <p>
      <br /><br />
      Reducing the items Active or Inactive items will remove the status icon.
      <br /><br />
      The Inventory tab is divided into four sections:
    </p>

    &nbsp;<span class="inventory-tab-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;

    <p>
      <br /><br />
      Items are dragged on to the sheet from item folders or Compendiums and by default, they will appear on the sheet as Inactive. <br /><br />
      Inactive items can be considered as being in a backpack/pocket/slung and do not contribute to Consumables, but they do contribute to Encumbrance.
      <br /><br />
      The Foot Locker section is for gear owned but stored elsewhere (locker/room etc.) to put an item in the Foot Locker right click on the edit icon to bring
      up the context menu and select "Add to Locker".
      <br />
    </p>
    &nbsp;<span class="inv-context-menu-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br />
    <p>
      Items in the Foot Locker are not counted against Encumbrance.
      <br /><br />

      To remove items from the Foot Locker, left or right click on the item's icon which will move it to the Active or Inactive section. <br />
      You can also select "Take From Locker" in the context menu which will move the item to "Inactive".
      <br /><br />

      For any other items or notes use the "Ad Hoc" text area at the bottom of the sheet. The Quick-Insert module can be used to create a link (see Recommended
      Add-on Modules).
      <br /><br />
      Weapons cannot be fired when Inactive or in the Foot Locker.
      <br />
    </p>
    &nbsp;<span class="inv-inact">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    <p>
      <br />
      Left clicking on the items image (1) will Activate the item. When Active right clicking on the item image will make it Inactive. Only Active weapons can
      be clicked on for rolls.
      <br /><br />
      Left clicking on an items edit icon (2) will open the item in edit mode. Right clicking on the edit icon (2) which will display a context menu with
      edit/delete options.
      <br />
    </p>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    &nbsp;<span class="inv-context-menu-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    <p>
      <br /><br />
      Some items have inline edit boxes (3) which enable you to edit some quantities (Rounds, Food, Water, Air, Quantity) without the need to open the item.
      <br /><br />
      <b>NOTE:</b> All Items can be dropped on to the macro bar (though only Weapons will trigger a roll). When using inline edit click on the number in the
      box, delete or backspace then enter the new number. Trying to highlight the number to edit will drag the entire item.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style="position: relative; margin-top: 30px">
    <h1 class="heading">Synthetics</h1>
    <p>
      If a player is using a "Secret Android" they should use the Character sheet and roleplay as a normal PC just ignoring any Stress Radiation or Condition
      effects. The GM can easily create a Character and Synthetic sheet for the player, this will enable them to keep up the pretence that they are a normal PC
      until the big reveal, at which point they can switch to the Synthetic sheet at the appropriate time.
      <br />
      Otherwise, they should use the Synthetic sheet which dispenses with any stats, conditions etc that do not affect them.
      <br /><br />
      If you do want to use the Synthetic sheet the player can make fake Stress and Push rolls by checking the "Imitate Human Panic and Push Button" (see
      below). <br />
      <br /><br />
      Much of the Synthetic sheet is the same as the normal Character sheet so here I will outline the major differences.
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading2">Header (1)</h3>
    <div class="imagecontainer">
      <img src="systems/alienrpg/images/mother-instructions/synthetic-header.webp" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 0%" alt="" />
    </div>
    <p>As Synthetics do not suffer from Stress that is omitted from their sheet. <br /></p>

    <h3 class="heading2">Details (2)</h3>
    <p>
      The main section of the General tab has the same fields as the Character sheet except for Signature Item as per the rules Synthetics do not have them.
      <br />
      Critical Injury items dragged on to the sheet will be displayed in Critical Injuries section and have the same controls for viewing, editing and deleting
      as a normal item. Players can roll their own Critical Hits by clicking on the "Roll Crit" button. This looks for a table named "Critical Injuries on
      Synthetics" for Androids. If the table does not exist an error message is displayed.
      <br /><br />

      &nbsp;<span class="synthetic-details">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading2">Tracking (3)</h3>
    <p>
      Synthetics do not suffer from Radiation or Conditions, so these are omitted from the left sidebar. <br /><br />
      While the rules state they do not have consumables, I have left Power for them as I am sure they use items that consume power which should be tracked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;<span class="synthetic-consumables">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br />
      The Skills and Inventory tabs operate the same as for a Character sheet
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Human Panic, Push, ect.</h2>
    <p>
      If the "Human Panic, Push..." checkbox is checked the sheet will display Conditions and Consumables for the player allowing them to set the conditions and
      roll against supplied to help simulate a human actor in play.
      <br /><br />
      Additionally, they can press the "Stress" button to make fake Stress rolls (they will never get over 6 so always shows as “Keeping it Together”). <br />
      On normal rolls the chat will display the Push button so will be displayed (it does nothing) so to other players as a normal player and they will need to
      find a suitable excuse not to push the roll.

    <p>
      &nbsp;<span class="creature-header">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br />
      When creating a Creature, the Health is represented as [current health]/[total health], i.e. 6/6. When the creature is injured the [current health] value
      should be manually reduced. These values are used in the token health bar for the creatures (See Tokens).
      <br /><br />
      By default, values are not entered for Mobility, Observation and Acid Splash as not all creatures have these abilities.
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading2">Attack Table (2)</h3>
    <p>
      Clicking on the Attack Table drop down will show a list of any attack tables that you have created in the "Alien Tables> Alien Creature Tables" folder.
      Once selected the table can be rolled against by clicking on the "Roll Attack" button.
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="creature-attack-dropdown">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
      <br />
      The result appears in the chat window as a "Public" message If you want the outcome to be private select the appropriate setting from the chat drop down.
      <br /><br />
      As with all chat messages, the detailed dice break down of any damage rolls can be seen by clicking on the dice icon in the chat window.
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="chat-roll">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br /><br />
      The Special Abilities section allows quick notes to be added with respect to the Creature or situation. More detailed notes can be added on the Notes tab
      in the rich text editor.
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading2">Creature Critical Injuries (3)</h3>
    <p>
      The GM can select a Critial Injuries table using the dropdown (by defailt it's set to "None") and the roll for Critial hits on the creature. The filter
      looks in the "Alien Mother Tables" folder for any table starting with "Critical Injuries" and lists them in the dropdown. If the table does not exist an
      error message is displayed.
      <br /><br />
      Right Clicking on the edit icon to the right will display a context menu allowing injury to be edited or deleted.
      <br /><br />
      You will have to manually add any modifiers the injury has on the character to the tab modifiers tab on the injury item. <br />
      <br />
      Right clicking on the "Roll Crit" button will display a dialogue box allowing the GM to enter a specific critical injury number. This must be in D6 format
      (number 1-6). This then rolls against the relevent table, writes to chat and creates the item on the sheet as per normal. <br />
      <br /><br />
      Using the Item type "critical-injury" a GM can create their own Critical Injury items which can then be dragged on to the sheet and will be displayed in
      this section and have the same controls for viewing, editing and deleting as a normal item.
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <h5>Creating your own Creature Critical Injuries Tables</h5>
    <p>
      If you want to create your own tables for creatures, add a table to "Alien Mother Tables" as normal ensuring it starts with "Critical Injuries ". <br />
      Make the Roll Table Formula 1d6. Add each of the rows as normal with the data in the following format: <br /><br />
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;b&gt;<em>Injury Name</em>&lt;/b /&gt;<em>Injury Description</em></pre>
    <p>
      <br />
      <strong>It is important to use this format as the code looks for the Injury Name within the bold html tags to create the item and message. </strong>

    <h3 class="heading2">Stats (1)</h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp;<span class="spaceship-header1">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br />
      Mostly text boxes to enter the ships stats with a few exceptions:
      <br /><br />
      <strong>CREW</strong> as with the vehicle sheet this is the maximum number of actors that can be dragged onto the sheet. <br /><br />
      <strong>HULL</strong> the hull points govern the maximum damage the ship can take and limit the <strong>DAMAGE</strong> dots at the bottom (note they do
      not reduce the number of outlines just how many can be checked.) <br /><br />
      <strong>ARMOR</strong> as with the character sheet this is a click-to-roll to make Armor saves. <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading2">Component Damage(2)</h3>
    <p>
      Clicking on the appropriate icon will roll against the Minor or Major component damage tables. An item is created on the sheet and the result is shown in
      chat. Any effects from damage need to be manually applied to the ship.
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading2">Crew (3)</h3>
    <p>
      The Crew section allows the GM drag PCs onto the sheet. <br />
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> ONLY THE GM CAN DRAG ACTORS ONTO THE VEHICLE. <br /><br />
      By default the crew member is assigned the position of "<strong>PASSENGER</strong>" though they still are part of the <strong>CREW</strong> count.
      <br /><br />
      Clicking on the dropdown allows the GM or Player to select one of the four roles:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CAPTAIN:</strong> Has no function on a other than shouting at the crew!</li>
      <li><strong>PILOT:</strong> Allows the player to fire weapons and make Piloting rolls.</li>
      <li><strong>GUNNER:</strong> Allows the player to fire weapons.</li>
      <li><strong>SENSOR-OP:</strong> Allows the player to make Comtech rolls.</li>
      <li><strong>ENGINEER:</strong> Has no function on a other than noting who has that role</li>
      <li><strong>PASSENGER:</strong> Along for the ride.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When "PILOT" is selected "PILOTING" will appear under the "ROLL" section of the Crew tab. <br />
      In order to make a Piloting (Thrusters rating added) check the player right clicks on this to make the roll (left click to see the modifier box). <br />
      The selected PCs stats and stress dice will then be used to make the piloting roll.
      <br /><br />
      When "SENSOR-OP" is selected "COMTECH" will appear under the "ROLL" section of the Crew tab. <br />
      In order to make a Comtech check the player right clicks on this to display the modifier box: <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="spaceship-comtech">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br />

      The selected PCs stats, stress and modifiers will then be used to make the comtech roll.
      <br /><br />

      Rolls can be PUSHED and the additional stress dice will be added to the PCs sheet as normal. <br />
      <br /><br />
      Clicking on the little Heart next to the actor will roll on the <strong>Space Combat Panic Roll</strong> table using the actors current stress rating.
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading2">Armaments (4)</h3>
    <p>
      Only spaceship weapons can be dragged onto this section. They operate in the same way as the ones on the Vehicle Sheet.<br /><br />
      Any Spaceship weapons dragged onto the Modules/Upgrades tab will automatically appear here.
      <br /><br />
      Left clicking on a weapon will show the weapon dialogue box. The drop down will show a list of the crew members that have been assigned the "GUNNER" role
      (see below). <br />
      The player selects their character and applies range and modifiers as instructed by the GM. <br />
      The selected range modifiers are automatically applied to the roll. <br />
      The selected PCs stats and stress dice will then be used to fire the weapon. <br />
      Rolls can be PUSHED and the additional stress dice will be added to the PCs sheet as normal. <br />

    <p>The Modules/Upgrades tab is split into three sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spaceship Weapons</li>
      <li>Modules/Upgrades</li>
      <li>Cargo</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Spaceship Weapons</strong><br />
      Only items with the Spaceship Weapons item type can be dragged into this section as per the rules. Any other weapon types will be shown under cargo and be
      inactive.
      <br /><br />
      Weapons cannot be fired from this tab.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Modules/Upgrades</strong><br />
      Any items of the Modules/Upgrades type will be displayed here. <br /><br />
      Any bonuses from these items need to be manually applied to the ship.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Cargo</strong><br />
      All other item types are treated as cargo and are stored in this section. As they are cargo they are inactive and can only be transferred to other actors
      when required.
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Image Tab</h2>
    <p>
      Where you can put a picture of the ship which will also be used as the token image.
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Space Combat Phases Tab</h2>
    <p>
      This is a very simple messaging system for the phases. There is no automation it just posts a message to chat.
      <br /><br />

      A per the rules initiative is rolled, as normal, for each spaceship.<br /><br />
      Each round is the split into 4 phases. At each phase the players, secretly, chose from one of the options for that phase. <br /><br />
      In order to simulate this the tab has a drop down for each phase with the appropriate options. The idea is the GM announces which phase you are in both
      sides make a choice from the dropdown for that phase (but do not push submit!)<br /><br />
      The GM then both sides (as instructed by the GM) then press submit and the chosen actions for that phase are displayed in chat. <br /><br />
      The actions are carried out and the GM and players proceed to he next phase and repeat the above.
      <br /><br />
      I said it was simple !
      <br /><br />
      Selections are not stored anywhere so will reset if the sheet is closed and opened.

    <p>
      The item sheet is for generic items for use within the game. When a new item is created, choose the relevant item sub category from the dropdown. This
      will dynamically change the sheet to include any relevant stats for that item type on its Attributes tab.
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="item-dropdown">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
      <br />
      Any stats entered for the item will have an in-system effect once the item is "Active".

      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="modifiers-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
      <br />
      Modifiers also have an in-system effect once the item is "Active".
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Weapon</h2>
    <p>
      Select the type on the sheet (Ranged or Melee) and the sheet will dynamically change to the relevant stats for that weapon type. The Class field is a text
      field which allow you to classify the weapon. This is not a required field and can be left blank.
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="melee-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="ranged-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
      <br />
      For a Melee weapon the range will be set to Engaged, for Ranged weapons select the appropriate range from the dropdown list. The Cost field will convert
      the input to a currency so all you need to enter is the number e.g., 15000 and it will reformat as US$15,000.00.
      <br /><br />
      The stats on the sheet will be used in rolls when the weapon is "Active".
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <h2 class="heading">Armor</h2>
    Setting up different armor types is simple as there are only two main stats to be considered, Armor Rating and Air Supply.
    <br />
    &nbsp;<span class="armor-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    <br />
    The additional modifiers some armor can have on attributes and abilities can be found on the Modifiers tab.
    <br />
    The stats and modifiers on the sheet will be used in rolls when the weapon is "Active".
    <br /><br />
    <h2 class="heading">Planet-System</h2>
    <p>
      The Planet-System sheet provides a method of documenting any planets the party might encounter during their missions. The fields are basic text and are
      intended to contain summaries. Where more detail is required, use the Rich Text editor in the Description tab. Once created these can be dragged onto the
      Territories sheet as previously mentioned. &nbsp;<span class="planet-system-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Agenda</h2>
    <p>
      The Agenda item provides a rich text field which can be used to provide additional scenario-based narrative/motivations for the players. These can be used
      as Agenda or Story cards. Once created, they can be dragged onto the PCs sheet where they appear on the Skills tab and can be viewed by the player by
      clicking on the name.
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Talent</h2>
    <p>
      This item type enables you to create talents for your game either homebrew or from the rulebook by adding descriptions to the rich test field. When
      dragged on to a PCs sheet, these will appear on the Skills tab and can be viewed by the player by clicking on the name.
      <br /><br />
      <b> NOTE:</b><br />
      With the exception of the "Nerves of Steel" talent, which will automatically add -2 to Stress rolls and the "Pack Mule" talent which increases total
      Encumbrance, Talents do not currently have an effect in the system so any impact deriving from a Talent needs to be applied manually during the game.
      <br /><br />
      For instance, the Compassion (Medic Talent) allows the PC to push their roll multiple times but the system will by default only allow a roll to be pushed
      once. In this situation the player should use the check box in the chat window "Allow multi-push". <br />
      When the situation complies with the Talent criteria the player checks the box, <b>before pushing the roll</b>, they then PUSH as normal and a Stress
      point is added to their sheet.

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Critical Injury</h2>
    <p>
      Critical Injury items can be dragged on to Character and Synthetic sheets to record permanent injuries as well as apply the appropriate roll modifiers as

    <p>
      Skill-Stunt items contain a rich text field that can be populated with the Stunt data from the rulebook for each of the skills.
      <br /><br />

      the system will malfunction.
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Spaceship Modules/Upgrades</h2>
    <p>

      to add or remove stress to the roll. Chat message for stress rolls shows the net modifier. A tooltip shows the individual modifiers by hovering the mouse
      over "Panic Condition" in the chat window.
      <br /><br />
      This will add/subtract the entered value (+x or -x) to the roll and does not change the number of dice rolled.
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="stress-mod">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />
      Supply rolls are made by clicking on the parachute icon. Any failures (1's) will automatically be deducted from the total and the items giving that value
      will be decremented.
      <br /><br />
      For Armor rolls the player just clicks on "Armor" and the appropriate number of dice are rolled with the result appearing in the character window. As
      before, the value depends on the equipped armor on the Inventory tab. Any reduction in armor value needs to be done in the detailed entry there.
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading2">PUSHing Rolls</h2>
    <p>
      Rolls can be pushed for "Human" PCs by clicking on the Push icon in the chat window. If the initial roll includes a Facehugger (1), the "Push" button will
      not be displayed. When a roll is pushed, the PC's Stress level will automatically be increased by 1. <br /><br />
      On a Pushed roll the second chat message will show the total successes for both rolls.
      <br /><br />
      Some Talents enable PCs to push a roll twice. As these are situational (+2 Wits when doing X) they are very hard to code into the system. <br />
      To allow players to make multiple PUSHes there is a check box in the chat window "Allow multi-push". <br />
      When the situation complies with the Talent criteria the player checks the box, <b>before pushing the roll</b>, they then PUSH as normal and a Stress
      point is added to their sheet.
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="mpush1">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />
      <br />
      The results of the PUSH will display along with the total to that point and a second PUSH button will show (as long as there are no Facehuggers).
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="mpush2">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />
      <br />
      If the results of the second push are sufficient they just inform the GM of the result and continue playing using those results.
      <br /><br />
      If there are still not enough successes to complete the task the player can push the roll a second time and an additional Stress point is added to the
      sheet.
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="mpush3">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />
      <br />
      Once again the total number of successes will be displayed for all three rolls.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style="position: relative; margin-top: 30px">
    <h1 class="heading2">Creatures</h1>
    <p>
      For Mobility, Armor, Armor Vs Fire and Observation rolls, a Left mouse click will roll the value and Right mouse click will display a modifier box
      allowing additional dice to be added or subtracted as necessary. As some creatures have a different armor stat against fire damage this is shown as a
      separate field.
      <br /><br />
      Where creatures have the "Acid Splash" ability, a left click will display a dialogue box requesting the amount of damage the PC inflicted on the creature.
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="acid-splash-popup">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
      <br />
      This is added to the creatures “Acid Attack” value and the corresponding number of base dice are rolled with the result displayed in the chat window. For
      each success, the PC suffers the appropriate amount of damage as outlined in the core rules which should be manually applied by the player.
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <h2 class="heading2">Ad Hoc Rolls</h2>
    <p>
      Alien RPG system uses custom dice notation for the Base and Stress dice.
      <br />
      If you want to roll ad-hoc dice and don't want to use the macros (See below). You can roll using:
      <br />
      /r xdb - for Base dice <br />
      /r xds - for Stress dice <br />
      where x is the number of dice.
      <br />
      For both just put /r 4db + 2ds
      <br /><br />
      If you need a D66 just use: <br />
      /r (1d6*10)+1d6
      <br />
      (Note this will not rill Alien dice just normal D6 if using DsN)
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style="position: relative; margin-top: 30px">
    <h1 class="heading">Combat Tracker</h1>
    <p>
      When rolling for initiative in the combat tracker the combatants will now be sorted in ascending order.
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="initiative-roll">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br /><br />
      When adding Creatures if their speed is greater than 1, clones will automatically be created equal to their speed. <br />
      If not required the GM can remove them by using the context menu.
      <br /><br />
      You can manually clone NPCs/Creatures by right clicking on an actor in the combat tracker you will see "Clone Actor" option appear. This will create a
      clone of the selected actor to allow the GM to give a Creature multiple initiative rolls. An actors initiative can be manually adjusted by selecting
      "Update Actor".
      <br /><br />
      &nbsp;<span class="clone-actor">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="roll-clone">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
      <br />
      Additionally, in the chat window an initiative card will be displayed. If you wish to modify these images you can by creating your own images (250x349px)
      png files and storing them in the \images\cards directory. Name the images in ascending order card-1.png to card-10.png. <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="init-chat-norm">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br /><br />
      If you have purchased either the Starter Set or Core Rules these will automatically be replaced with the official Initiative cards.
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="init-chat-cards">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br /><br />
      There are only 10 initiative cards, so if you have a combat with more than 10 actors and roll initiative the system will roll the first 10 then roll for
      any extras and add two decimal places to the rolls i.e. 3.42.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style="position: relative; margin-top: 30px">
    <h1 class="heading">Tables</h1>
    <p>When the system is installed it will create the following folder structure:</p>
    <table style="width: 43%; border: 0px">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 30%">Alien Tables -&gt;</td>
          <td style="width: 50%">Alien Creature Tables&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 30%">&nbsp;</td>
          <td style="width: 50%">Alien Mother Tables</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      This structure is used by the Creature sheet and the two "roll on table" macros (See Macros) which are set up to display only the rollable tables in those
      folders.
      <br />
      Free League have given me permission to include the Panic Table in the core system, which can be found in the Alien Mother Tables.
      <br /><br />
      If you want to create your own rollable tables, you should do so in the appropriate folder.
      <br /><br />
      When entering the tables from the rulebook for D66 tables use 10*1d6+1d6 as the roll table formula and you will be able to import the ranges as per the
      book.
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h1 class="heading">System Configuration Options</h1>
    <p>
      There are a number of system configuration options available to GM and players under Configuration Settings>System Settings:
      <br />
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading2">GM Configuration Options</h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp;<span class="gm-settings">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br /><br />
      Hopefully, most of the settings are self-explanatory.
      <br /><br />
      Enabling the "Add Settings Button" will place a quick access button on the Configure Settings sidebar to quickly allow the GM and Players to change fonts
      and text colours.
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="style-button-settings">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br /><br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading2">Player Configuration Options</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;<span class="player-settings">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br /><br /></p>
    <h3 class="heading2">Font and Colour Configuration Options</h3>
    <p>
      When I first created the system, I wanted to give the feel of the old CRT monitors you see in the films. While this initially looks good after playing for
      a while the text style and colour can be a little intense. <br />
      Additionally, having the text colour green can cause issues for people with sight problems.
      <br /><br />
      There is also an option to change the Journal font color settings. <br />
      Please note that some of the font colors are baked into the modules journal settings so will not change.
      <br /><br />
      FranzWarm wrote a really great add-on module called CRT UI. Unfortunately he no longer supports the module so I have incorporated it into the core
      system.<br /><br />
      The UI components are now on by default and the sheets can be changed, by the players, selecting the CRT UI button on the "Configure Alien RPG Settings"
      menu. <br /><br />
      The can be reverted to the default sheet by selecting the "Reset" option.
      <br /><br />
      In order to make the system more accessible, there are configuration options available to change these settings for individual players. &nbsp;<span
        class="style-settings"
        >&nbsp;</span
      >&nbsp; <br /><br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;<span class="font-picker-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="colour-picker-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br /><br />
      Clicking the Reset button will return the system to the defaults.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style="position: relative; margin-top: 30px">
    <h1 class="heading">Macros</h1>
    <p>
      The Alien system comes with 4 macros that will help you run the game smoothly. <br /><br />
      These can be found in the Compendium under Macro>Alien. I suggest you right click and do an "Import All Content" to get them into your library.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style="padding-bottom: 2%">
        <strong style="color: deepskyblue">Alien - GM Dice Roller:</strong> Allows you to perform ad-hoc dice rolls. Uncheck the GM Only box to make the rolls
        public.
      </li>
      <li style="padding-bottom: 2%">
        <strong style="color: deepskyblue">Alien - Player Ad-hoc YZE Dice Roller: </strong>Make this available to your players. They need to have a token
        selected before running the macro.
      </li>
      <li style="padding-bottom: 2%">
        <strong style="color: deepskyblue">Alien - Roll on selected Mother table:</strong> provides a drop down listing all the Mother Tables available. Allows
        multiple rolls against the table and modifiers (+/- x to roll not additional dice).
      </li>
      <li style="padding-bottom: 2%">
        <strong style="color: deepskyblue">Alien - Roll on selected Creature table: </strong>same as above for Creature tables but no modifiers and all rolls
        are private to the GM.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If you want to write your own macros these are the @ tags.
      <br />
      For Attributes:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none">
      <li>@str</li>

    <br />
    <p>For Skills:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none">
      <li>@heavyMach</li>

      <li>@comtech</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      So to roll for comtech with stress would be: <br />
      /r (@wit)db + (@comtech)db + (@stress)ds
      <br /><br />
      <i>Please note that rolling dice from a macro or in chat will not trigger the "Push" or Stress automation.</i>

    <h1 class="heading">Recommended Add-on Modules</h1>
    <p>
      While not necessary to use the Alien system of this module I would recommend installing the following Add-on modules as they make the GM's job a lot
      easier: <br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style="padding-bottom: 2%">
        <strong style="color: deepskyblue">Dice So Nice:</strong> <br />Alien RPG supports 2 dice face types. The new version also allows the GM to add animated
        effects to dice rolls.
      </li>
      <li style="padding-bottom: 2%">
        <strong style="color: deepskyblue">Quick Insert - Search Widget:</strong> <br />Allows you to quickly search for assets and drag them directly on to the
        scene, sheets or rich text fields.
      </li>
      <li style="padding-bottom: 2%">
        <strong style="color: deepskyblue">Alien RPG - Motion Tracker:</strong> <br />The module installs a button just over the chat box that you can hit. When
        hit, the button will scan for the nearest active and visible tokens based on the selected token. This is still under development but is a really good
        effect to add tension to a scene.
      </li>
      <li style="padding-bottom: 2%">
        <strong style="color: deepskyblue">Year Zero Engine: Combat</strong><br />
        adds ability to track Fast/slow actions as well as other features. <br />
      </li>
