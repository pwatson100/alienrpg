Left mouse click on the dot to set and Right mouse click on the dot to unset. <br /><br />Adding Radiation will cause a roll to determine if there is any health damage caused by the radiation. <br /><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> If there is it must be applied manually I did not automate this in case there are any cures to be applied. <br /> <span class=\"radiation-roll\"> </span>  <br />Right click to remove radiation after a visit to the medbay or cure. This will make a permanent radiation check by rolling a 1d6, on a  <span class=\"stresssymbol\"> </span>  permanent radiation will be added to the right side of the radiation bar. <br />Actors with permanent radiation will always have the \"Radiation\" condition icon showing on their token even if they have no temporary radiation.</p>\n<div class=\"imagecontainer\"><img style=\"width:40%;margin-bottom:0%\" src=\"systems/alienrpg/images/mother-instructions/perm-radiation.webp\" alt /></div>\n<p>Permanent radiation can <strong>ONLY BE REMOVED OR ADDED BY THE GM.</strong> <br />CTRL-Right click on the character sheet to remove. <br />Adding permanent radiation is done by a CTRL-Left click. <br /><br />Overwatch is a (left click) toggle and gives an \"Eye\" status icon on the token so show the actor is in Overwatch. <br /><br />If the player has an <strong>active</strong> token in the scene a status icon will show for any conditions set:</p>\n <span class=\"status-icons-img\"> </span>  <br />\n<p>Right clicking on the condition will remove the status icon. <br /><strong> NOTE:</strong> <em>Removing the status icon from the token HUD will not remove the condition on the actor sheet. </em> <br /><br />The \"Panicked\" condition will automatically set following panic rolls of 7+. This triggers the \"More Panic\" mechanics in the system. To remove the Panicked condition right click on the “PANICKED” dot. This will reset the PC's panic level to 0. When active it will also display the “Panic Level” to the player to show how near breaking they are. <br /><br /><strong> NOTE:</strong> <em>This does not affect their Stress level.</em> <br /><br />The consumables and Armor values are updated automatically based on the \"Active\" items in the PC's Inventory (See Inventory for more details.) <br /><br /></p>\n<h3 class=\"heading2\">Consumables</h3>\n<p>In the system all the items \"Active\" consumable values are combined to give these totals. All supply rolls will rolla maximum of 6 supply dice as per the rules. <br /><br />For Air, Food and Water just click on the Parachute icon to make a supply roll. Failures are removed from the value of the corresponding items in the PCs Inventory in the order they were added. <br /><br />Power supply rolls are made against the individual items on the Inventory tab by clicking on the value in the Pwr column. <br />This will roll the total number of power dice (to a maximum of 6) but on a failure (Facehugger) will only deduct from the item the power roll is made for. <br /><br />This is a near as I can get to the actual rules which are a little vague when it comes to Power supply rolls.  <span class=\"pwr-supply\"> </span>  <br />Once the power level is zero it will no longer roll and the player will need to edit the item in order to change the power level. <br /><br /></p>\n<h3 class=\"heading2\">Armor</h3>\n<p>Clicking on Armor will roll the combined value of any active armor (total shown in the box). <br />Right clicking will display a modifier box with one-click options for \"Armor Piercing\" (half armor value) and \"Armor Doubled\" (2 x armor value). <br /><br />Additionally, right or left clicking on the name of armor on the Inventory tab will also perform an Armor roll or show a modification chat box.</p>\n <span class=\"armor-mod\"> </span> \n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h3 class=\"heading2\">Critical Injuries (4)</h3>\n<p>Players can roll their own Critical Hits by clicking on the \"Roll Crit\" button. This looks for a table named \"Critical injuries\" for Characters. If the table does not exist an error message is displayed. <br /><br />Right Clicking on the edit icon to the right will display a context menu allowing injury to be edited or deleted. <br /><br />If you have the Core Rules or Starter Set modules enabled when on rolling a Critical Injury for a PC or Synthetic the Critical Injury item will be automatically created and added to the actors sheet. <br />You will have to manually add any modifiers the injury has on the character to the tab modifiers tab on the injury item. <br /><br />Right clicking on the \"Roll Crit\" button will display a dialogue box allowing the player/GM to enter a specific critical injury number. This must be in D66 format (number 11 to 16, 21 to 26 etc.) for Characters and D6 format for Synthetics (1-6). This then rolls against the relevent table, writes to chat and creates the item on the sheet as per normal. <br /><br /><br />Using the Item type \"critical-injury\" a GM can create their own Critical Injury items which can then be dragged on to the sheet and will be displayed in this section and have the same controls for viewing, editing and deleting as a normal item. <br /><br />It is now possible to create your own Cirt tables for Characters and Synthetics. <br /><br />The roll tables must be called \"Critical Injuries\" and \"Critical Injuries on Synthetics\". <br /><br />The Critical Injuries table for Characters must use the following Roll Table Formula : 10*1d6+1d6 and be constructed as a d66 table with ranges from 11 to 16, 21 to 26 and so on. Each of the entries but be constructed in the following format. If you do not use this format the injury items will not be created correctly and the system will error.</p>\n<pre>&lt;b&gt;INJURY: &lt;/b&gt;NAME OF INJURY &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;FATAL: &lt;/b&gt;YES or NO&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;TIME LIMIT: &lt;/b&gt;See Below &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;EFFECTS: &lt;/b&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;HEALING TIME: &lt;/b&gt;XX days\n  </pre>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TIME LIMIT values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>None</li>\n<li>OneRound</li>\n<li>OneTurn</li>\n<li>OneShift</li>\n<li>OneDay</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br />For \"Critical Injuries on Synthetics\" the table must have a Roll Table Formula of 1d6. <br /><br />Each of the entries but be constructed in the following format.

These are updated by the player during character creation. <br /> <span class=\"moskills\"> </span>  <br />Left mouse click will roll the value, taking into account current stress dice. <br />A Right mouse click will display a modifier dialogue box allowing you to add or subtract Base and Stress dice to the roll. <br />For instance, having the Field Surgeon Talent gives a +2 modification to Medical Aid, so you would add 2 to the base dice in the modifier box. <br /><br />Skill rolls are combined with the associated attribute values and Stress dice when making rolls. <br /><br />Clicking on the spanner icon <span class=\"spanner-icon\"> </span> next to a skill will display the appropriate stunts for that skill at the bottom of the sheet, a second click hides the description. (See Skill Stunts below). <br /><br /> <span class=\"talent-agenda\"> </span>  <br />The Talents and Agenda/Story Cards sections allow the player/GM to drop talent and agenda items (see below) onto the characters sheet. Clicking on the item’s name will display the items description at the bottom of the sheet.

The two arrows on the Encumbrance show the point at which the PC should be taking penalties for being over encumbered. <br /> <span class=\"enc\"> </span>  <br />When the carried items exceed this point the bar will turn red and flash.</p>\n <span class=\"enc-warn\"> </span>  <br />\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p>If the player has an <strong>active</strong> token in the scene a status icon will show: <br /><br /></p>\n <span class=\"enc-icon-img\"> </span> \n<p><br /><br />Reducing the items Active or Inactive items will remove the status icon. <br /><br />The Inventory tab is divided into four sections:</p>\n <span class=\"inventory-tab-img\"> </span> \n<p><br /><br />Items are dragged on to the sheet from item folders or Compendiums and by default, they will appear on the sheet as Inactive. <br /><br />Inactive items can be considered as being in a backpack/pocket/slung and do not contribute to Consumables, but they do contribute to Encumbrance. <br /><br />The Foot Locker section is for gear owned but stored elsewhere (locker/room etc.) to put an item in the Foot Locker right click on the edit icon to bring up the context menu and select \"Add to Locker\".</p>\n <span class=\"inv-context-menu-img\"> </span>  <br />\n<p>Items in the Foot Locker are not counted against Encumbrance. <br /><br />To remove items from the Foot Locker, left or right click on the item's icon which will move it to the Active or Inactive section. <br />You can also select \"Take From Locker\" in the context menu which will move the item to \"Inactive\". <br /><br />For any other items or notes use the \"Ad Hoc\" text area at the bottom of the sheet. The Quick-Insert module can be used to create a link (see Recommended Add-on Modules). <br /><br />Weapons cannot be fired when Inactive or in the Foot Locker.</p>\n <span class=\"inv-inact\"> </span> \n<p><br />Left clicking on the items image (1) will Activate the item.

When using inline edit click on the number in the box, delete or backspace then enter the new number. Trying to highlight the number to edit will drag the entire item.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"position:relative;margin-top:30px\">\n<h1 class=\"heading\">Synthetics</h1>\n<p>If a player is using a \"Secret Android\" they should use the Character sheet and roleplay as a normal PC just ignoring any Stress Radiation or Condition effects. The GM can easily create a Character and Synthetic sheet for the player, this will enable them to keep up the pretence that they are a normal PC until the big reveal, at which point they can switch to the Synthetic sheet at the appropriate time. <br />Otherwise, they should use the Synthetic sheet which dispenses with any stats, conditions etc that do not affect them. <br /><br />If you do want to use the Synthetic sheet the player can make fake Stress and Push rolls by checking the \"Imitate Human Panic and Push Button\" (see below). <br /><br /><br />Much of the Synthetic sheet is the same as the normal Character sheet so here I will outline the major differences. <br /><br /></p>\n<h3 class=\"heading2\">Header (1)</h3>\n<div class=\"imagecontainer\"><img style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:0%\" src=\"systems/alienrpg/images/mother-instructions/synthetic-header.webp\" alt /></div>\n<p>As Synthetics do not suffer from Stress that is omitted from their sheet.</p>\n<h3 class=\"heading2\">Details (2)</h3>\n<p>The main section of the General tab has the same fields as the Character sheet except for Signature Item as per the rules Synthetics do not have them. <br />Critical Injury items dragged on to the sheet will be displayed in Critical Injuries section and have the same controls for viewing, editing and deleting as a normal item. Players can roll their own Critical Hits by clicking on the \"Roll Crit\" button. This looks for a table named \"Critical Injuries on Synthetics\" for Androids. If the table does not exist an error message is displayed. <br /><br /> <span class=\"synthetic-details\"> </span>  <br /><br /></p>\n<h3 class=\"heading2\">Tracking (3)</h3>\n<p>Synthetics do not suffer from Radiation or Conditions, so these are omitted from the left sidebar. <br /><br />While the rules state they do not have consumables, I have left Power for them as I am sure they use items that consume power which should be tracked.</p>\n<p> <span class=\"synthetic-consumables\"> </span>  <br />The Skills and Inventory tabs operate the same as for a Character sheet</p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\">Human Panic, Push, ect.</h2>\n<p>If the \"Human Panic, Push...\" checkbox is checked the sheet will display Conditions and Consumables for the player allowing them to set the conditions and roll against supplied to help simulate a human actor in play. <br /><br />Additionally, they can press the \"Stress\" button to make fake Stress rolls (they will never get over 6 so always shows as “Keeping it Together”). <br />On normal rolls the chat will display the Push button so will be displayed (it does nothing) so to other players as a normal player and they will need to find a suitable excuse not to push the roll.</p>\n<div class=\"imagecontainer\"><img style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:0%\" src=\"systems/alienrpg/images/mother-instructions/synthetic-sheet-human.webp\" alt /></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"position:relative;margin-top:30px\">\n<h1 class=\"heading\">Creatures</h1>\n <span class=\"creature-sheet-img\"> </span>  <br />\n<h3 class=\"heading2\">Header (1)</h3>\n <span class=\"creature-header\"> </span>  <br />When creating a Creature, the Health is represented as [current health]/[total health], i.e. 6/6.

If the table does not exist an error message is displayed. <br /><br />Right Clicking on the edit icon to the right will display a context menu allowing injury to be edited or deleted. <br /><br />You will have to manually add any modifiers the injury has on the character to the tab modifiers tab on the injury item. <br /><br />Right clicking on the \"Roll Crit\" button will display a dialogue box allowing the GM to enter a specific critical injury number. This must be in D6 format (number 1-6). This then rolls against the relevent table, writes to chat and creates the item on the sheet as per normal. <br /><br /><br />Using the Item type \"critical-injury\" a GM can create their own Critical Injury items which can then be dragged on to the sheet and will be displayed in this section and have the same controls for viewing, editing and deleting as a normal item. <br /><br /></p>\n<h5>Creating your own Creature Critical Injuries Tables</h5>\nIf you want to create your own tables for creatures, add a table to \"Alien Mother Tables\" as normal ensuring it starts with \"Critical Injuries \". <br />Make the Roll Table Formula 1d6.

When a new item is created, choose the relevant item sub category from the dropdown. This will dynamically change the sheet to include any relevant stats for that item type on its Attributes tab. <br /> <span class=\"item-dropdown\"> </span>  <br />Any stats entered for the item will have an in-system effect once the item is \"Active\". <br />Item types: Data Storage,Diagnostics Display,Pharmaceuticals and Clothing have a Quantity field to record the number owned. <br />The Consumables type is a general item that includes stats for Power, Food, Water and Air Supply for any homebrew items. <br /><br />The modifiers tab allows you to add any +/- effects using the item may have on the PCs attributes or skills. <br /> <span class=\"modifiers-img\"> </span>  <br />Modifiers also have an in-system effect once the item is \"Active\". <br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\">Weapon</h2>\n<p>Select the type on the sheet (Ranged or Melee) and the sheet will dynamically change to the relevant stats for that weapon type.

The Cost field will convert the input to a currency so all you need to enter is the number e.g., 15000 and it will reformat as US$15,000.00. <br /><br />The stats on the sheet will be used in rolls when the weapon is \"Active\". <br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\">Armor</h2>\nSetting up different armor types is simple as there are only two main stats to be considered, Armor Rating and Air Supply. <br /> <span class=\"armor-img\"> </span>  <br />The additional modifiers some armor can have on attributes and abilities can be found on the Modifiers tab. <br />The stats and modifiers on the sheet will be used in rolls when the weapon is \"Active\". <br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"heading\">Planet-System</h2>\nThe Planet-System sheet provides a method of documenting any planets the party might encounter during their missions. The fields are basic text and are intended to contain summaries. Where more detail is required, use the Rich Text editor in the Description tab. Once created these can be dragged onto the Territories sheet as previously mentioned.  <span class=\"planet-system-img\"> </span> \n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\">Agenda</h2>\n<p>The Agenda item provides a rich text field which can be used to provide additional scenario-based narrative/motivations for the players. These can be used as Agenda or Story cards. Once created, they can be dragged onto the PCs sheet where they appear on the Skills tab and can be viewed by the player by clicking on the name. <br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\">Talent</h2>\n<p>This item type enables you to create talents for your game either homebrew or from the rulebook by adding descriptions to the rich test field. When dragged on to a PCs sheet, these will appear on the Skills tab and can be viewed by the player by clicking on the name. <br /><br /><strong> NOTE:</strong><br />With the exception of the \"Nerves of Steel\" talent, which will automatically add -2 to Stress rolls and the \"Pack Mule\" talent which increases total Encumbrance, Talents do not currently have an effect in the system so any impact deriving from a Talent needs to be applied manually during the game. <br /><br />For instance, the Compassion (Medic Talent) allows the PC to push their roll multiple times but the system will by default only allow a roll to be pushed once. In this situation the player should use the check box in the chat window \"Allow multi-push\". <br />When the situation complies with the Talent criteria the player checks the box, <strong>before pushing the roll</strong>, they then PUSH as normal and a Stress point is added to their sheet. <br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\">Critical Injury</h2>\n<p>Critical Injury items can be dragged on to Character and Synthetic sheets to record permanent injuries as well as apply the appropriate roll modifiers as defined on the Modifiers tab. <br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\">Skill-Stunt</h2>\n<p>Skill-Stunt items contain a rich text field that can be populated with the Stunt data from the rulebook for each of the skills. <br /><br />If any of the official modules (Starter Set or Core Rules) are installed, the text in these items will be ignored but the items should not be deleted or the system will malfunction. <br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\">Spaceship Modules/Upgrades</h2>\n<p>Used to create Modules and Upgrades. Any bonuses must be manually applied to the ship stats/rolls. <br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\">Spaceship Weapons</h2>\n<p>Weapons created can only be used on starships. The first dropdown sets the type (Offensive/Defensive) and depending on the selection other stats will become available. <br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\">Spaceship Crit</h2>\n<p>Template used to create Spaceship critical hits. Any effects must be manually applied to the ship stats/rolls.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"position:relative;margin-top:30px\">\n<h1 class=\"heading\">Tokens</h1>\n<p>When a Character actor is dragged onto a Scene the token will show resource bars for Stress and Health when the cursor is hovered over the token: <br /> <span class=\"character-token\"> </span>  <br /><br />For Creatures, the Health resource bar is shown: <br /> <span class=\"creature-token\"> </span>  <br /><br />By default, NPCs and Creature tokens are set as Hostile and Unlinked.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"position:relative;margin-top:30px\">\n<h1 class=\"heading\">Rolling Dice</h1>\n<p><strong> NOTE:</strong> <em> The PC/Creature token needs to be selected for all rolls.</em> <br /><br /><em><strong> All GM Rolls are public by default but can be made private by using the Chat dropdown and selecting \"Private GM Roll\".</strong></em></p>\n<h2 class=\"heading2\">Characters and NPCs</h2>\n<p>For Strength, Agility, Wits and Empathy rolls a Left mouse click will roll the value and Right mouse click will display a modifier box allowing additional dice to be added or subtracted as indicated by the GM. <br /> <span class=\"agil-mod\"> </span>  <br /><br /><br />Stress is automatically added on a Push (see Rolls below) but any other adjustments to a characters Stress need to be made manually. The Stress value is taken into account on all dice rolls. <br /><br />For Panic rolls, the player Left clicks on \"Stress\" and the result is displayed in the chat window. Right Clicking on \"Stress\" will display a modifier box to add or remove stress to the roll. Chat message for stress rolls shows the net modifier. A tooltip shows the individual modifiers by hovering the mouse over \"Panic Condition\" in the chat window. <br /><br />This will add/subtract the entered value (+x or -x) to the roll and does not change the number of dice rolled. <br /> <span class=\"stress-mod\"> </span>    <br /><br />Supply rolls are made by clicking on the parachute icon. Any failures (1's) will automatically be deducted from the total and the items giving that value will be decremented. <br /><br />For Armor rolls the player just clicks on \"Armor\" and the appropriate number of dice are rolled with the result appearing in the character window. As before, the value depends on the equipped armor on the Inventory tab. Any reduction in armor value needs to be done in the detailed entry there. <br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"heading2\">PUSHing Rolls</h2>\n<p>Rolls can be pushed for \"Human\" PCs by clicking on the Push icon in the chat window. If the initial roll includes a Facehugger (1), the \"Push\" button will not be displayed. When a roll is pushed, the PC's Stress level will automatically be increased by 1. <br /><br />On a Pushed roll the second chat message will show the total successes for both rolls. <br /><br />Some Talents enable PCs to push a roll twice. As these are situational (+2 Wits when doing X) they are very hard to code into the system. <br />To allow players to make multiple PUSHes there is a check box in the chat window \"Allow multi-push\". <br />When the situation complies with the Talent criteria the player checks the box, <strong>before pushing the roll</strong>, they then PUSH as normal and a Stress point is added to their sheet. <br /> <span class=\"mpush1\"> </span>    <br /><br /><br />The results of the PUSH will display along with the total to that point and a second PUSH button will show (as long as there are no Facehuggers). <br /> <span class=\"mpush2\"> </span>    <br /><br /><br />If the results of the second push are sufficient they just inform the GM of the result and continue playing using those results. <br /><br />If there are still not enough successes to complete the task the player can push the roll a second time and an additional Stress point is added to the sheet. <br /> <span class=\"mpush3\"> </span>    <br /><br /><br />Once again the total number of successes will be displayed for all three rolls.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"position:relative;margin-top:30px\">\n<h1 class=\"heading2\">Creatures</h1>\n<p>For Mobility, Armor, Armor Vs Fire and Observation rolls, a Left mouse click will roll the value and Right mouse click will display a modifier box allowing additional dice to be added or subtracted as necessary. As some creatures have a different armor stat against fire damage this is shown as a separate field. <br /><br />Where creatures have the \"Acid Splash\" ability, a left click will display a dialogue box requesting the amount of damage the PC inflicted on the creature. <br /> <span class=\"acid-splash-popup\"> </span>  <br />This is added to the creatures “Acid Attack” value and the corresponding number of base dice are rolled with the result displayed in the chat window. For each success, the PC suffers the appropriate amount of damage as outlined in the core rules which should be manually applied by the player. <br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"heading2\">Ad Hoc Rolls</h2>\nAlien RPG system uses custom dice notation for the Base and Stress dice. <br />If you want to roll ad-hoc dice and don't want to use the macros (See below). You can roll using: <br />/r xdb - for Base dice <br />/r xds - for Stress dice <br />where x is the number of dice. <br />For both just put /r 4db + 2ds <br /><br />If you need a D66 just use: <br />/r (1d6*10)+1d6 <br />(Note this will not rill Alien dice just normal D6 if using DsN)\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"position:relative;margin-top:30px\">\n<h1 class=\"heading\">Combat Tracker</h1>\n<p>When rolling for initiative in the combat tracker the combatants will now be sorted in ascending order. <br /> <span class=\"initiative-roll\"> </span>  <br /><br />When adding Creatures if their speed is greater than 1, clones will automatically be created equal to their speed. <br />If not required the GM can remove them by using the context menu. <br /><br />You can manually clone NPCs/Creatures by right clicking on an actor in the combat tracker you will see \"Clone Actor\" option appear. This will create a clone of the selected actor to allow the GM to give a Creature multiple initiative rolls. An actors initiative can be manually adjusted by selecting \"Update Actor\". <br /><br /> <span class=\"clone-actor\"> </span>   <span class=\"roll-clone\"> </span>  <br />Additionally, in the chat window an initiative card will be displayed. If you wish to modify these images you can by creating your own images (250x349px) png files and storing them in the \\images\\cards directory. Name the images in ascending order card-1.png to card-10.png. <br /> <span class=\"init-chat-norm\"> </span>  <br /><br />If you have purchased either the Starter Set or Core Rules these will automatically be replaced with the official Initiative cards. <br /> <span class=\"init-chat-cards\"> </span>  <br /><br />There are only 10 initiative cards, so if you have a combat with more than 10 actors and roll initiative the system will roll the first 10 then roll for any extras and add two decimal places to the rolls i.e. 3.42.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"position:relative;margin-top:30px\">\n<h1 class=\"heading\">Tables</h1>\n<p>When the system is installed it will create the following folder structure:</p>\n<table style=\"width:43%\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:30%\">Alien Tables -&gt;</td>\n<td style=\"width:50%\">Alien Creature Tables </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:30%\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width:50%\">Alien Mother Tables</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This structure is used by the Creature sheet and the two \"roll on table\" macros (See Macros) which are set up to display only the rollable tables in those folders. <br />Free League have given me permission to include the Panic Table in the core system, which can be found in the Alien Mother Tables. <br /><br />If you want to create your own rollable tables, you should do so in the appropriate folder. <br /><br />When entering the tables from the rulebook for D66 tables use 10*1d6+1d6 as the roll table formula and you will be able to import the ranges as per the book. <br /><br /></p>\n<h1 class=\"heading\">System Configuration Options</h1>\n<p>There are a number of system configuration options available to GM and players under Configuration Settings&gt;System Settings:</p>\n<h3 class=\"heading2\">GM Configuration Options</h3>\n <span class=\"gm-settings\"> </span>  <br /><br />Hopefully, most of the settings are self-explanatory. <br /><br />Enabling the \"Add Settings Button\" will place a quick access button on the Configure Settings sidebar to quickly allow the GM and Players to change fonts and text colours. <br /> <span class=\"style-button-settings\"> </span>  <br /><br /><br />\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"heading2\">Player Configuration Options</h3>\n <span class=\"player-settings\"> </span>  <br /><br />\n<h3 class=\"heading2\">Font and Colour Configuration Options</h3>\n<p>When I first created the system, I wanted to give the feel of the old CRT monitors you see in the films. While this initially looks good after playing for a while the text style and colour can be a little intense. <br />Additionally, having the text colour green can cause issues for people with sight problems. <br /><br />There is also an option to change the Journal font color settings. <br />Please note that some of the font colors are baked into the modules journal settings so will not change. <br /><br />FranzWarm wrote a really great add-on module called CRT UI. Unfortunately he no longer supports the module so I have incorporated it into the core system.<br /><br />The UI components are now on by default and the sheets can be changed, by the players, selecting the CRT UI button on the \"Configure Alien RPG Settings\" menu. <br /><br />The can be reverted to the default sheet by selecting the \"Reset\" option. <br /><br />In order to make the system more accessible, there are configuration options available to change these settings for individual players.  <span class=\"style-settings\"> </span>  <br /><br /><br /> <span class=\"font-picker-img\"> </span>   <span class=\"colour-picker-img\"> </span>  <br /><br />Clicking the Reset button will return the system to the defaults.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"position:relative;margin-top:30px\">\n<h1 class=\"heading\">Macros</h1>\nThe Alien system comes with 4 macros that will help you run the game smoothly. <br /><br />These can be found in the Compendium under Macro&gt;Alien. I suggest you right click and do an \"Import All Content\" to get them into your library.\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien - GM Dice Roller:</strong> Allows you to perform ad-hoc dice rolls.
