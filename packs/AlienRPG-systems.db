Thirty-five years after the Nostromo incident, Weyland-Yutani and the Colonial dministration set up an atmospheric processor on the swiftly turning moon and began terraforming procedures. The moon was renamed Acheron by its early settlers, and Hadley’s Hope\r\nendured there for more than twenty years. The colony stopped transmitting reports in July of 2179, prompting a visit by a contingent of colonial marines. Whatever transpired next led to the nuclear annihilation of the colony and the death of\r\nboth the colonial marine unit and all 158 colonists.\r\nWhat caused the destruction is uncertain—conflicting reports range from an attack by a rival government or unknown alien species to a simple reactor accident and meltdown. All that remains is a radioactive wasteland stretching over 700 km.\r\nSoon after the incident, both Weyland-Yutani and the Colonial Marines sent search and rescue teams to Acheron in the hopes of finding survivors.\r\n\r\nWhile the colony and the atmospheric processor were vaporized, it was theoretically possible that any colonists who made it as far as the Ilium Range would be protected from the blast by the mountains there.
